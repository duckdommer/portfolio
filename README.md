# portfolio My project is a portfolio page. It showcases my video and still photography work. I used java script to create a slideshow for my still work. When a thumbnail is clicked, the picture will appear in a modal. You can close the picture by clicking the word close in the top right hand corner. It is responsive. The pictures on the still section will reduce to one column on a mobile phone.
There are too many CSS selectors to speak of. I have included a video constainer at the top of the page. It has rounded corners. The video itself has a reduced opacity for better visibilty. The video will adjust to a different screen size. 
The pages have a sticky footer that includes social media links.
There's also a nav-bar. I used flex to keep the design responsive.
