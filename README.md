# portfolio 
My project is a portfolio page. It showcases my video and still photography work. I used Java Script (function slides) to create a slideshow for my still work. When a thumbnail is clicked (img.onclick), the picture will appear in a modal. You can close the picture modal by clicking the word "CLOSE" (span.onclick) on the top right hand corner. It is responsive. The pictures on the still section will reduce to one column on a mobile phone.
There are too many CSS selectors to speak of. I have included a video container at the top of the page (.video-container and .video). It has rounded corners. The video itself has a reduced opacity for better visibilty. The video will adjust to a different screen size. 
The pages have a sticky footer that includes social media links.
There's also a nav-bar. I used flex to keep the design responsive. The CSS selectors for it include .navbar ul and .navbar li . Those selectors change the background color to a blueish color. They add space evenly around it. .navbar li a:hover changes the color when you hover over a link.

I also included a large first letter on the index.html page. (.home p::first-letter) It has a black background with rounded corners and a white letter.
